"""
The LexisParser class is a class that can read and parse LexisNexis TXT files from filenames. Initialise the to
load the regex patterns and then use the parse_file(fname) method to parse a file. Returns a list of dicts with
all variables contained in the text file.

Example use:
    lp = LexisParser()
    corpus = lp.parse_file("lexisnexis.txt")
